Task
==============================
Create a C++ library, with a function (and necessary types) for ray tracing triangles.

The function should
 - Take in a ray (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)#Ray) and a triangle as arguments.
 - Return something that the consumer can use to determine:
   - If the triangle was hit.
   - What is the distance from the origin of the ray to the intersection point.
   - The intersection point it self.

Assume that this library is a core part of a software product, may need to be modified in the future, and will be used by many different consumers.
Please provide some code that both tests the library and shows how to use the library.

General Notes
==================================

- Don't hesitate asking follow-up questions.
